# DA5401 A7 — Multi-Class Model Selection using ROC and PRC

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook for **Assignment 7** of the *DA5401 – Data Analytics* course.  
The task focuses on **multi-class model selection** using **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)** and **Precision–Recall (PRC)** analysis on the **UCI Landsat Satellite dataset**.

---

##  Objective

To compare and evaluate multiple multi-class classifiers using:
- **Weighted F1-score** and **Accuracy** (baseline performance)
- **Macro-averaged ROC AUC** (ranking performance)
- **Mean Average Precision (AP)** (precision–recall performance)

The goal is to identify the most reliable model for multi-class classification based on combined ROC and PRC metrics.
